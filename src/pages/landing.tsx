          <strong>EVMcrispr</strong> is a powerful tool that combines a domain-specific language with a Javascript library to interact with Aragon DAOs. With it, you can bundle <strong>many DAO operations into just one script</strong>, generating a singular transaction, usually a vote. These commands include installing or upgrading apps, changing their permissions, executing actions or interacting with external contracts.
